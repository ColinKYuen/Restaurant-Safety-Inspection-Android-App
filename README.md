## Issues
Some Restaurants have the EXACT same address causing issues with Google Maps Markers. Issues such as overlapping (as they are in the EXACT same location), and on clicking causes it to open all Restaurant Details. Spoken to Karan about this, and was told to put into README & Email Teaching Team.
